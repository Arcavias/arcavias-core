	 * The interval of calling this method depends on the expiration of the
	 * entries. If most of your cache entires expire after midnight, it's a good
	 * idea to clean up the cache a few minutes afterwards.
	 *
	 * When the expiration occurs randomly distributed over the whole day, then

	 * of time between each cleanup() call depends on the size of your cache and
	 * the amount of expired entries. The more entries has been expired, the more
	 * often cleanup() should be called. But if your cache size is very big it
	 * might be a good idea to remove the cache entries at a time of less
	 * activity because cleaning up the cache can be a long running task.
	 *
	 * Implementations for cache servers that care about expiration themselves
	 * simply do nothing and return immediately.

	 * the list or object again. The maximum length of a value is 16 MB.
	 *
	 * Additionally, one or more tags can be associated to each key/value pair
	 * in the cache:
	 *
	 * <code>

	 * that relates to several other items and should be found with getListByTag()
	 * or deleted with deleteListByTag(). The maximum allowed length for tags
	 * is 255 bytes.
	 *
	 * You can also specify an expiration date for the key:
	 *
	 * <code>
	 * $cache->set( 'product/id/100', '<string>', array(), '2100-01-01 12:00:00' );

	 *
	 * You should keep the time on both servers in sync to get expected results.
	 * Also, the date/time values for expiration are sensitive to time zones.
	 * Make sure your web server and your cache server use the same time zone.
	 * Otherwise, cache entries will be dropped earlier or later than specified

	/**

	 *
	 * <code>

	 * );

	 * in the cache:
	 *
	 * <code>
	 * $tags = array(
	 * 	'product/id/100/name' => 'product/id/100',
	 * 	'product/id/100/prices' => array( 'product/id/100', 'price' ),
	 * );
	 * $cache->setList( $pairs, array(), $tags );
	 * </code>
	 *
	 * In this case, the tag 'product/id/100' would be associated to the first
	 * two keys listed in the $pairs array from above. To the second key the
	 * tag 'price' would be associated too and no tag would be assocated to the
	 * key 'product/id/100/object'. The keys in the $tags list must be the same
	 * as the keys in $pairs. If a key in $tags is used that is not available in
	 * $pairs, then it is ignored. The maximum allowed length for tags is 255
	 * bytes.
	 *
	 * You can also specify an expiration date for each key in $pairs by adding
	 * the key from $pairs and the date/time as value:
	 *
	 * <code>
	 * $expires = array(

	 * );
	 * $cache->set( $pairs, array(), $expires );
	 * </code>
	 *
	 * In the example, 'product/id/100/name' would have already been expired
	 * while 'product/id/100/object' would stay in the cache till Jan. 1, 2100
	 * at noon. No expiry date is associated to 'product/id/100/prices', so it
